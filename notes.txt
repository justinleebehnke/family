I would like a page, to grab the json data for that person.

Page has an ID and refers to a person.

When you click on a person, facts are loaded in as well as the person's name and image.

Relationships are also loaded in.

Marriage, Parents, Children.

Blue if they have their own page, black if not.

And I will have a fake API of sorts that lets you go to a page.

A page is about a person and it contains facts as well as the person's name.

A page contains, facts, and sources.

Names and relationships and life events are all types of facts.

A person can have a relationship with a person based on the existence of a shared child.
A child may belong to an unknown mother.

All facts must have sources.

So there is the structure of the data, and there is the data itself.
Also the work must be published in Ancestry and also in Family Search so that other people can collaborate with me on things.

Some facts have photos, 
Some people have photos,


Now, the most important things are


/person
/facts
/sources

The same source may be cited for many facts.
A single fact may cite multiple sources.
Some facts are relationships.
Some facts are life events.
